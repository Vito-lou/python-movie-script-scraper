This repository is primarily aimed at utilizing Python for scraping movie scripts, intended for personal English language practice purposes. Please refrain from using it for any illegal activities

## TODO

- [x] solve the pagination issue
- [x] get all the scrips and write them into a movie_scripts.md file
- [ ] fix the sentence break issue; test.py is the first attempt
